I would like to thank the professors of the Algorithms and Computer Programming course at [UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/) for the opportunity to be a tutor in this course, which improved my ability to solve syntax and logic problems in the Python language, as well as my ability to communicate and teach.
